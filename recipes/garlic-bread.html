        <h5>Perfect garlic bread from scratch</h5>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Bread</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 Cups of Flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp. Salt</li>
                <li>1 Cup Warm Water</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp. Instant Yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp. Sugary</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. Oil</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Garlic Butter</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 - 1/3 Cup Butter (Room Temp)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. Dill</li>
            <li>6 Garlic Cloves, Minced (I Run it Through My Garlic Grinder)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. Salt</li>
            <li>1/2tsp. Fresh Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>Mix the yeast and sugar in a measuring cup that keeps it from getting lumpy, add the cup of warm water and stir together. Let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
               <li>Mix 2 cups flour and salt in a medium sized bowl, then dump in the yeast mix and stir until a soft dough forms.</li>
               <li>Kneed until dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour if needed. don't add so much flour that it becomes dry; it should still be slightly sticky.</li>
               <li>Rinse out the bowl and swirl the oil around ; put the dough back in and turn it over so it's coated.</li>
               <li>Cover the bowl (i like to wrap a tea towel over and under it), and place in a warm (not hot!) oven to rise. I usually turn my oven on to the lowest setting that will turn on the element for 5 min, and then turn it off.</li>
               <li>Turn the oven up to 375f for 20 minutes. My oven runs a little cool so I turn it up to closer to 380 or 390. A little too warm is better than a little too cool, in this case. After 20 min, it should be nicely golden on top. Let it cool until no more than warm.</li>
               <li>In the meantime, mix all ingredients of the garlic butter.</li>
               <li>Slice vertically into 3/4-1 inch slices, leaving the bottom crust intact. Carefully pull slices apart so you can spread the butter on each side of each slice without breaking them apart.</li>
               <li>Wrap loosely but completely in foil and bake at 400f for 10-15 minutes.</li>
               <li>Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
