        <h3>Steps</h3>
             <ol>
                <li>Preheat barbecue grill to high heat.</li>
                <li>Prepare gratinata sauce by melting 3 tablespoons of butter in a medium saucepan over medium/low heat. Add garlic and sweat it for about 5 minutes. Be sure the garlic doesn't brown. Add the Marsala wine and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients for the sauce and whisk well until smooth. Bring mixture to a simmer and keep it there for 10 minutes or until it's thick. Cover sauce and remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Cook pasta following directions on the package (7 to 9 minutes). You want the pasta tender but not mushy (just al dente). Strain pasta and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Pound the thick end of your chicken breast with a kitchen mallet to make them a uniform thickness. Rub chicken with olive oil, then sprinkle salt and pepper. Spear the shrimp on skewers (6 per skewer), then rub them with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Grill chicken for 5 to 6 minutes per side. Grill shrimp for 2 minutes per side. When the chicken is done, slice each breast into strips.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 500. You can make this in one large ceramic dish or individually in smaller dishes.
