# odin-recipes
Foundations Course (HTML Foundations).

This project is intended to practice our current HTML skillset acquired from the Foundations Course from The Odin Project.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

This project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
